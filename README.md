hi hii

I'm Sebastian, 22yo from Italy. I'm gonna be honest and admit that I'll probably never write anything remotely useful since I'm very lazy and I prefer doing other things in my free time

I guess that if I had more nerd friends I'd be more prone to develop stuff but I really get bored easily while coding.

Idk i like games and consoles so if you want to develop something related to weeb stuff hmu

I'm friendly I promise

I can speak italian, english, spanish and a bit of chinese

Currently studying Python after getting a 18/30 in advanced C and a 22/30 in Java but i swear i'm good
